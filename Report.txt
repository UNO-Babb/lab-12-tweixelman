Questions to answer:
1) What was the worst case scenario for any sorting technique?


2) The first 3 sorts have the same runtime of O(n^2). Why were the times different? Why would one be more efficient than the others?


3) Why was merge sort so much more efficient?


4) The built-in sorting technique for most programming languages is known as TimSort.
This is a merge sort until the arrays have fewer than 10 elements, then it does an insertion sort. Why would this be useful?


5) What issues can you see with a recursive sorting technique like merge sort?
